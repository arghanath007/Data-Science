I am very excited to share the dashboard that I have created in Power-BI and is a submission for the Codebasics Resume project challenge 3 which is to Provide Insights to the Executive team in Telecom Domain about 5G in AtliQo .



Once again a big thanks to codebasics Dhaval Patel and Hemanand Vadivel for hosting these awesome and wonderfulÂ resume project challenges where I could work on improving my skills as well as build domain knowledge with each challenge. Thanks again for giving me this awesome opportunity.



The purpose of the dashboard is that it is providing important insights to the AtliQo Executive team and helping them come up with solutions to their problems.



Some of the Measures that I have created:


1) Calculating the total revenue

2) Calculating the average revenue

3) Calculating the average ARPU or average revenue per user

4) Calculating the total active users

5) Calculating the total unsubscribed users

6) Calculating the monthly active users

7) Calculating the market share % of AtliQo

8) Calculating the revenue before and after 5G separately

9) Calculating the ARPU before and after 5G separately.

10)Calculating the active users before and after 5G separately.

11) Calculating the unsubscribed users before and after 5G separately.


I have definitely learned a lot while creating this dashboard.


I have uploaded my dashboard and a few images of it on my GitHub.
