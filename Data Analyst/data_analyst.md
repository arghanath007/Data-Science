# Data Analyst

> Someone who collects, transforms and organizes data in order to help make informed decisions.
>Data Analyst answers to existing questions by creating insights from data sources.

## Important Points to Remember as a Data Analyst

1. Group up the measures in a separate table.
2. Understanding the **Calculate** function in DAX is very important.
3. We can also create additional columns in the data using DAX.
4. Keep the most important insights at the **top left corner** of the report as most of the people read from left to right. Do the opposite if you are in a country where people read from right to left.
5. A good insights report should enable the people(Stakeholders, Co-founder, CEO, HR, etc.) to ask more why's on the Top KPIs.
6. Copy and paste the visuals and alter them to boost the productivity.

* **MVP** -> Minimum Viable Product

## Steps to follow when starting a new project

1. Pick colors based on some/similar company logos in that field or create your own. Create a **custom palette**.
2. Create a **custom background** for the report/dashboard.
3. Create a **Mock-up** of the report.
4. **Load the data** into PowerBi.(Single file or multiple files).
5. Create the **needed Measures** for the report/dashboard.
6. Find some **illustrations/SVGs** for the report/dashboard.

## Data Analysis life cycle

1)Ask

>It’s impossible to solve a problem if you don’t know what it is. These are some things to consider:

    * Define the problem you’re trying to solve 

    * Make sure you fully understand the stakeholder’s expectations

    * Focus on the actual problem and avoid any distractions

    * Collaborate with stakeholders and keep an open line of communication

    * Take a step back and see the whole situation in context

> Questions to ask yourself in this step:

    * What are my stakeholders saying their problems are?

    * Now that I’ve identified the issues, how can I help the stakeholders resolve their questions?

2)Prepare

> You will decide what data you need to collect in order to answer your questions and how to organize it so that it is useful. You might use your business task to decide.

    * What metrics to measure

    * Locate data in your database

    * Create security measures to protect that data

> Questions to ask yourself in this step:

    * What do I need to figure out how to solve this problem?

    * What research do I need to do?
3)Process

> Clean data is the best data and you will need to clean up your data to get rid of any possible errors, inaccuracies, or inconsistencies. This might mean:

    * Using spreadsheet functions to find incorrectly entered data

    * Using SQL functions to check for extra spaces

    * Removing repeated entries

    * Checking as much as possible for bias in the data

> Questions to ask yourself in this step:

    * What data errors or inaccuracies might get in my way of getting the best possible answer to the problem I am trying to solve?

    * How can I clean my data so the information I have is more consistent?
4)Analyze

> You will want to think analytically about your data. At this stage, you might sort and format your data to make it easier to

    * Perform calculations

    * Combine data from multiple sources

    * Create tables with your results

> Questions to ask yourself in this step:

    * What story is my data telling me?

    * How will my data help me solve this problem?

    * Who needs my company’s product or service? What type of person is most likely to use it?
5)Share

> Everyone shares their results differently so be sure to summarize your results with clear and enticing visuals of your analysis using data via tools like graphs or dashboards. This is your chance to show the stakeholders you have solved their problem and how you got there. Sharing will certainly help your team:  

    * Make better decisions

    * Make more informed decisions

    * Lead to stronger outcomes

    * Successfully communicate your findings

> Questions to ask yourself in this step:

    * How can I make what I present to the stakeholders engaging and easy to understand?

    * What would help me understand this if I were the listener?
6)Act

> Now it’s time to act on your data. You will take everything you have learned from your data analysis and put it to use. This could mean providing your stakeholders with recommendations based on your findings so they can make data-driven decisions.

> Questions to ask yourself in this step:

    * How can I use the feedback I received during the share phase (step 5) to actually meet the stakeholder’s needs and expectations?

### Structured Thinking

> These six steps can help you to break the data analysis process into smaller, manageable parts, which is called structured thinking. This process involves four basic activities:

* Recognizing the current problem or situation
* Organizing available information
* Revealing gaps and opportunities
* Identifying your options

### Big and Small Data

* Reference -> <https://www.coursera.org/learn/ask-questions-make-decisions/supplement/VAdzR/big-and-small-data>

## Life Cycle of Data

1)Plan: Decide what kind of data is needed, how it will be managed, and who will be responsible for it.

2)Capture: Collect or bring in data from a variety of different sources.
3)Manage: Care for and maintain the data. This includes determining how and where it is stored and the tools used to do so.

4)Analyze: Use the data to solve problems, make decisions, and support business goals.

5)Archive: Keep relevant data stored for long-term and future reference.
6)Destroy: Remove data from storage and delete any shared copies of the data.

## Asking the right questions (Ask Phase)

> Effective questions follow the SMART methodology.

### SMART Methodology

* Reference -> <https://www.coursera.org/learn/ask-questions-make-decisions/supplement/nULlj/more-about-smart-questions>

Specific:
Measurable:
Action-oriented:
Relevant:
Time-bound:

### Clear Communication

> Think about some of these things before communication. Clear Communication is key.
* Reference -> <https://www.coursera.org/learn/ask-questions-make-decisions/supplement/WmZKd/data-scenarios-and-responses>

* Who is your audience? -> Other Data Analyst and Project Manager and eventually VP of sales, who is your stakeholder.

* What they already know
* what they need to know
* How can you communicate that effectively to them.

### Meeting Best Practices

* Reference -> <https://www.coursera.org/learn/ask-questions-make-decisions/supplement/4H8Ic/leading-great-meetings>

### It has four components

1) **Purpose Or Benefits**
2) **Clients or Stake-holders**
3) **End Result**
4) **Success Criteria**

*ETL* -> Extract, Transform, Load

## WorkFlow in Data Analysis or Analytics

1) Get the Data either from excel, database or from something else.
2) Import the data into Power BI.
3) Create a Mock Report, discussing all the things that are needed for the report, make a rough sketch of it before trying to build the report.
4) Analyze the data, check if the data has some problems, missing values, outliers, garbage values, etc.
5) Data Modelling -> *Star Schema*
6) Transforming the data(ETL) i.e cleaning the data(removing unnecessary values). Search **Transform Data** in Power BI.
7) Data Pipeline.
8) Close and Apply, to apply all the transformation changes to the data.
9) Building the dashboard
10) Publish the dashboard to the web for others to see on the team or managers need to see it. Need a business email id to publish the dashboard.
11) Publish the dashboard to be viewed on mobile as well.

## Building a Report/Dashboard in PowerBi

1) Import the data into Power BI.
2) Analyze the data, check if the data has some problems, missing values, outliers, garbage values, etc.
3) Clean the data, remove unnecessary values by **transforming the data**.
4) Check the modelling of the data, if it is in a star schema or not. Make necessary links between the tables.
5) Build a mock report, discuss with the team what all things are needed in the report. Make a rough sketch of it before trying to build the report.
6) Build the report, add visuals, slicers, filters, etc.

> To view the report via web, phone or from another computer, we need to publish the report. Search **Publish** in Power BI. We would need a **Business Email** for that.
