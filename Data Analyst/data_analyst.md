# Data Analyst

> Someone who collects, transforms and organizes data in order to help make informed decisions.
>Data Analyst answers to existing questions by creating insights from data sources.

## Data Science

> Creating new ways of modelling and understanding the unknown by using raw data.
> Data Scientists create new questions using data.

## Data Analysis

> It is the process of getting insights from the data. It is the process of analyzing the data.
> The Collection, transformation, and organization of data in order to draw conclusions, make predictions and drive informed decision making.

## Data Analytics

## Life Cycle of Data

1)Plan: Decide what kind of data is needed, how it will be managed, and who will be responsible for it.

2)Capture: Collect or bring in data from a variety of different sources.
3)Manage: Care for and maintain the data. This includes determining how and where it is stored and the tools used to do so.

4)Analyze: Use the data to solve problems, make decisions, and support business goals.

5)Archive: Keep relevant data stored for long-term and future reference.
6)Destroy: Remove data from storage and delete any shared copies of the data.

### It has four components

1) **Purpose Or Benefits**
2) **Clients or Stake-holders**
3) **End Result**
4) **Success Criteria**

*ETL* -> Extract, Transform, Load

## WorkFlow in Data Analysis or Analytics

1) Get the Data either from excel, database or from something else.
2) Import the data into Power BI.
3) Create a Mock Report, discussing all the things that are needed for the report, make a rough sketch of it before trying to build the report.
4) Analyze the data, check if the data has some problems, missing values, outliers, garbage values, etc.
5) Data Modelling -> *Star Schema*
6) Transforming the data(ETL) i.e cleaning the data(removing unnecessary values). Search **Transform Data** in Power BI.
7) Data Pipeline.
8) Close and Apply, to apply all the transformation changes to the data.
9) Building the dashboard
10) Publish the dashboard to the web for others to see on the team or managers need to see it. Need a business email id to publish the dashboard.
11) Publish the dashboard to be viewed on mobile as well.

## Building a Report/Dashboard in PowerBi

1) Import the data into Power BI.
2) Analyze the data, check if the data has some problems, missing values, outliers, garbage values, etc.
3) Clean the data, remove unnecessary values by **transforming the data**.
4) Check the modelling of the data, if it is in a star schema or not. Make necessary links between the tables.
5) Build a mock report, discuss with the team what all things are needed in the report. Make a rough sketch of it before trying to build the report.
6) Build the report, add visuals, slicers, filters, etc.

> To view the report via web, phone or from another computer, we need to publish the report. Search **Publish** in Power BI. We would need a **Business Email** for that.
