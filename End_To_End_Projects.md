## Tips

1. Create projects that you are **passionate** about. They will be niche projects but you are passionate about them. 
2. Create an **interesting** project. Create your own **unique** project with your **own dataset**.
3. Upload your project on **Github**, **Kaggle**, **YouTube** and **Medium**
4. Creating appealing and **interactive** visualizations is a plus point. Creating visuals that are **summarizing** my long lines of code is a plus point. **Visuals** are important for getting the attention of the recruiter.
5. Make clean dashboard, visuals, info-graphic, power-point presentation and publish them to the public for everyone to see. PPTs could be used to summarize my hardcore technical skills. **Don't tell them** but **show them** your skills and I know what I am doing.
6. Create a project which has **some impact** on other people. The project creates some impact. If I build something for the community then go post it in the community like **Reddit**, **Linkedin**, **YouTube**.
