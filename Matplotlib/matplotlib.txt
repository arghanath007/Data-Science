It is a plotting library and more specifically a python plotting library. It helps us to turn the data into some pretty visualizations also knows as plots or figures. 

There are two types of way of plotting in matplotlib:-

1)Pyplot API
2)Object-oriented interface


*** In general, try to use the object-oriented interface over the pyplot interface.


Object oriented API:-

So the figure is the base canvas and the axes are like we're drawing on that base canvas.


If we have access to the data doesn't mean we have the knowledge.
