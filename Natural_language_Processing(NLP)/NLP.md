**NLP** -> Natural Language Processing
**NLU** -> Natural Language Understanding

>Traditionally, Computers were designed to work on numbers and they were pretty good at tasks that were related to numbers.
    Using NLP, we can have the computer assist us in language related tasks.


## Some NLP use cases:-

1) Language Conversion(Google Translate)
2) Google Search Engine(Helps to find the correct answers to the question we have)
3) Voice Assistance(Sir, Alexa, Google Assistance)
4) Suggesting words when writing an email.

## Career opportunities:-

1) Data Scientist specializing in NLP
2) NLP Researcher
3) NLP Engineer


## Some Pretrained Models:-

1) Fasttext
2) Tensorflow Hub
3) GPT3

## NLP Tasks

1) Text Classification
2) Text Similarity
3) Information Extraction
4) Information Retrieval(BERT, TFIDF score)
5) Chat Bots(FAQ, Flow Based Bot, Open-Ended Bot)
6) Machine Translation
7) Language Modeling(Sentence Auto-complete)
    1) Statistical Model 2) Neural Model

8) Text summarization.
9) Topic Modeling
10) Voice Assistants


## NLP Pipelining Steps:

1) **Data Acquisition** -> Gathering/acquiring necessary data to solve an NLP problem.

2) **Text Extraction and Cleanup** -> Discard Irrelevant information and fix spelling mistakes.

3) **Pre-Processing** ->

   1) **Sentence Segmentation/tokenization** -> Creating sentences from the whole paragraph

   2) **Word Tokenization** ->  Creating words from each sentence.

   3) **Stemming** -> Rules to come up with base words. Example: Loves -> Love, Eating -> eat, ate -> ate

   4) **Lemmatization** -> Mapping the words to their base words. Example -> ate -> eat.


4) **Feature Engineering** -> TF-IDF, One Hot Encoding, Word Embedding.

5) **Model Building** 

6) **Evaluation**

7) **Deployment**

8) **Monitor and Update**




Need to learn -> **Cosine similarity.**


## NER(Named Entity Recognition)

**Use Cases**

1) Search -> Latest News
2) Recommendations -> Recommendations from previous search history.
3) Customer Care Service.


### Build own NER

1) Simple Lookup Table with hardcoded values.
2) Rule Based NER (Like in Spacy)
3) Machine Learning (CRF and BERT)  CRF -> Conditional Random Field


## NLP Libraries

1) Spacy -> Object Oriented NLP Library. This out of the box gives us the best algorithm, best option and it works. It is like the camera of a smartphone.

2) NLTK -> String Processing Library. It is like a DSLR manual camera, which we need to tweak to get the full potential of this powerful library.
