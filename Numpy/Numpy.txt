1) The functionalities that numpy library offers are actually written in C programming language. So it will work extremely fast compared to python. Which is very much needed when doing complex compulation on larger datasets.
    It is fast

2) The idea of converting these data into something that a machine can understand like numbers(binary) which are in either zero or one. It allows us to make machine learn different operations. Machine learns by performing multiple operations.

3)Numpy full form -> Numerical Python.

No matter what type or what shape the numpy array is, all of the functions or the data manipulations will work if the data is stored in a 'numpy array' or in an 'numpy.ndarray'. 'numpy.ndarray' this is an universal datatype and it is very very flexible.
